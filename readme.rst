Harvard X - CS50x - Intro to Computer Science
==============================================

Overview
--------
This repository will help guide us through the CS50x Course from Harvard. I
might jump between the youtube version (2018) and the current EdX version
(2022). However, much of the content is the same. 

The course is taught by David J Maclan

Structure
---------
each folder will have its own code base (if needed) along with hopefully a
relevant markdown or rst file for some of the general notes.

Course start date
-----------------
2022-05-25
