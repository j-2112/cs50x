Intro to computer science

**What is computer science?**

Computer Science
    Fundamentally, Computer Science is *problem solving* 
    It is a representation of ideas

Unary
    Each digit represents a value of 1
    Think about how we count with our fingers, or how we make lines in the sand

Decimal
    0-9 counting system. This is like base 10, and is very efficient. This is
    by default what humans use, however, computers have a *physical limitation*
    that does not allow this type of counting

Binary
    Similar to the decimal system or base 10, however this is base 2. Each
    digit is either ``on`` or ``off``. This is perfect for computers, because
    they use electricity to function.

Transistors
    One of the inventions that fundamentally changed computing. These are
    *silicone based* and are classified as a **semiconductor**. Silicon has a
    tightly packed structure of electrons and like to share one. Valence
    electrons are not easily accessed.

    Passing a current over the silicon makeup allows for electricity to flow
    through a circuit  or switch.

    These may be represented as ``on`` or ``off``. This is how computing works

Bit
    binary digit, one on / off transistor so to speak

Byte
    A group of 8 bytes
